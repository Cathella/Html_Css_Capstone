# Html Capstone Project

![screenshot](./img/Conference.png)

## Project Description
This project required that we turn the following design as specified [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015) into HTML and CSS using our custom content. We were required to use flexbox and a framework of your choice or grid framework. 
I mainly used flexbox to create this project in its responsive nature. I defined my own classes to make all the pages appear well on the differnt screen viewports.

## How it was Implemented

I considered creating the desktop view first then continued to make it responsive with smaller and bigger screen sizes using define classes from scratch.
